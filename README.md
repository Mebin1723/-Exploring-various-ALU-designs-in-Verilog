# -Exploring-various-ALU-designs-in-Verilog
This project focuses on the exploration and implementation of different Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designs using Verilog, a hardware description language widely used in digital system design. The ALU is a critical component in a CPU, responsible for performing a variety of arithmetic and logic operations, which are the foundation C P.
